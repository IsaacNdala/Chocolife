## About the Project
Chocolife is a HTML/CSS & Bootstrap for an online chocolate candy store. The application also focuses on sharing tips and advices to take care of mouth hygiene in addition to sell candies.

The idea originated at high school in 2018 when my teacher of enterprising requested the class to create a group project for presenting at the annual enterprising fair FEAL (Feira de Empreendedorismo Alda Lara), then I thought would be great if I created a website for our organization, so that was what I did.
